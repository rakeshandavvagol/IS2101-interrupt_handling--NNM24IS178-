# IS2101-interrupt_handling--NNM24IS178-
The Interrupt Controller Simulation (Java) demonstrates how an interrupt controller operates within a computer system. It models how different I/O devices—Keyboard, Mouse, and Printer—generate interrupt signals that demand CPU attention. Each device is assigned a priority level, with the keyboard having the highest, the mouse medium, and the printer the lowest. The program showcases how the CPU handles these interrupts based on priority and how masking can temporarily disable certain devices from sending interrupts. Random interrupt generation is used to simulate real-time events, while clear console logs display how the system responds to each interrupt, either handling or ignoring it depending on masking status.

This simulation allows users to observe interrupt behavior through simple console commands such as masking, unmasking, checking device status, or quitting the program. It effectively demonstrates key concepts such as interrupt generation, Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) execution, priority-based scheduling, and masking. By integrating Java’s multithreading features, the project provides a hands-on understanding of how modern operating systems manage concurrent device requests in real-time, making the concept of interrupts more intuitive and practical than theoretical study alone.
